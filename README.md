## Map
Code for Pittsburgh worked on loading and displaying data

Started by Mark Howe @mhowe0422 

Data is from home listed for items to sell


## Application notes

These maps are based on the Google Map API

The current API key is registered to mhowe so if you clone/copy the code please use
your own API key.

The code is split out to html (View) and the code for the javascript (Model and Controller) in a separate file.

The main map display is index.html and based on bootstrap.js.

Used fixed xml file for the data that has the addresses already geo-coded
